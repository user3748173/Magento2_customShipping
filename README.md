<h1><i>[DEVELOPING]</i> CUSTOM SHIPPING MODULE</h1>

BASED ON UX RESEARCH I HAVE CHANGED THE FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT CREATING THIS MODULE AND HAVE DECIDED TO ADD ADDITIONAL BLOCK BELOW SHIPPING METHOD FIELD THAT IS CONNECTED WITH CHOSEN SHIPPING METHOD. ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS COME FROM MOBILE DEVISES THE BEST WAY TO CARATIE BEST UX IS TO ADD AUTCOMPLETE FIELD NOT DROPDOWN MENU AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED.

<b>[CURRENT STATE: REPLACING SHIPPING METHOD VALUE WITH DROPDOWNS.]</b>
